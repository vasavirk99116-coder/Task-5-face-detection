This project demonstrates face detection using OpenCV and Haar Cascade classifier.
The model detects human faces in an image and draws bounding boxes around them.

## Tools Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- Google Colab

## Output
The output image shows detected faces highlighted with rectangles.# Task-5-face-detection
